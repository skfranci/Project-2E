# Project-2E
Scientific Question: What is the evolutionary relationship, inferred from Cytochrome B, of the feeding habits among different species of Darwin's finches?

Files uploaded:
(1) Jupyter Notebook of final draft
(2) Uploaded individual FASTA files containing Cytochrome B sequences for each different finch species 
(3) FASTA file with all of the finch sequences
(4) Multiple sequence alignment file

FASTA files were found on the Nucleotide Database on NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/)
